CSS


display:
--------
none - hides element from layout
inline - stays in the same line - only takes up as much space as needed
block - default of most elements - start on new line and take as much space as available
inline-block - lets boxes sit side by side (adjacent) like inline elements but allows setting width, height, padding & margin like inline elements
flex - applies to a parent box - turns parent into flex container and its children into flex items - by default, children act as in-block elements
grid - applies to a parent box - turns parent into grid container and its children into grid items - mainly used for structured, grid-like layouts


Grid + Flexbox
--------------
main/inline axis - vertical
cross/block axis - horizontal
    - grid axis is strict, flex axis is variable
    # ie: grid-auto-flow: column; -> grid axis does not get flipped
    # ie: flex-direction: column; -> flex axis does get flipped

justify-content - aligns the whole row of items inside a container

Flexbox
-------


Grid
----
justify-items - aligns each item inside its own grid cell horizontally
align-items - aligns each item inside its own grid cell vertically
    shorthand:
        # place-items: center; -> justify-items: center; + align-items: center;

JavaScript

Concepts
+-------+
localStorage - Web API object - part of Web Storage API - storage object built into browser
             - useful for persisting ui preference (ie: dark theme) or client-side cart on reload
             - localStorage is similar to a php cookie - both live in browser, holding key-value data


Libraries
---------
Chart.js - very easy graphing # <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
         # best practice keeping <canvas> in its own container for responsiveness

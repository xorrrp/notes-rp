Web APIs
---------
localStorage - store, read, add, modify and delete data items stored in browser with no expiration date
             - useful for persisting ui preference (ie: dark theme) or client-side cart on reload
             - localStorage is similar to a php cookie - both live in browser, holding key-value data

fetch - make HTTP requests to web server from web browser
      - based on async and await - fetch returns a promise
      - best used for simple json api


Libraries
---------
Chart.js - very easy graphing # <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
         # best practice keeping <canvas> in its own container for responsiveness
